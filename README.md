# GitHub Party! ðŸŽ‰

See who else is viewing GitHub issues in real-time! This project consists of two parts:
1. A partykit app to store information about who is viewing issues
2. A Chrome extension that integrates with GitHub's interface

Welcome to the party, pal!

This is a [Partykit](https://partykit.io) project, which lets you create real-time collaborative applications with minimal coding effort.

[`server.ts`](./src/server.ts) is the server-side code, which is responsible for handling WebSocket events and HTTP requests.

[`web-extension`](./web-extension) is the code for the Google Chrome extension. It connects to the partykit socket and stores information about currently viewing users. It uses esbuild to build into `web-extension-dist` (which is where you should install the extension from during development).

## Prerequisites

## Installation

2. Install dependencies:
